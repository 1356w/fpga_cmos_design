	#WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net icon_control0<13> is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
	#WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <ila0_trig1<5>> is incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
